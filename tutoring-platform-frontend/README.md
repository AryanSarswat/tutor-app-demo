# Tutoring Platform Frontend MVP - Project Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Tutoring Platform Frontend MVP, a React and TypeScript application designed for tutors to manage students, log sessions, and generate reports.

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure with the following main directories:

```
tutoring-platform-frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/            # Page components for different routes
│   ├── services/         # API and service functions
│   ├── contexts/         # React context providers
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   ├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
│   ├── assets/           # Static assets
│   ├── routes/           # Routing configuration
│   └── tests/            # Unit tests
├── App.tsx               # Main application component
└── index.tsx             # Application entry point
```

## Features

### Session Logging
- Log new session form with:

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
The application uses React Context API for global state management, particularly for authentication state. Local component state is managed with React's useState hook.

### Form Handling
Forms are implemented using React Hook Form for efficient form state management, validation, and submission.

### Routing
React Router is used for navigation between different pages and components.

### API Integration
The application includes mock API services that simulate backend interactions. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual API calls.

### Testing
Unit tests are implemented using Jest and React Testing Library, covering key components and functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a real backend API
- Actual PDF generation and email sharing
- Enhanced reporting features
- Student portal for viewing session reports
- Mobile-responsive design improvements

## Notes
This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) implementation focusing on core functionality. The codebase is structured to allow for easy extension and enhancement in future iterations.
